# Regression_House-prices

We predict the sales prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa using the Ames Housing dataset compiled by Dean De Cock and hosted on Kaggle. The dataset includes 79 explanatory variables. After preprocessing the data, we train a XGBoost model and determine the best estimator for the model through hyperparameter tuning. We then predict house prices on unseen data.
